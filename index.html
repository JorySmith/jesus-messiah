  <h1>Jesus Christ the Messiah</h1>
  <h2>A Righteous Role Model of the Highest Good</h2>
  <p>Jesus Christ's Holy Words, Divine Actions, and Will:</p>
  <p>
    Ask, and it will be given to you. </br>
  Seek, and you will find. </br>
  Knock, and the door will be opened to you. </br>
  Be Righteous, Grateful, and Generous to all People.</br>
  Be Wise, Trustworthy, and Forgiving of all People.</br>
  Be Courageous, Healing, and Loving to all People.
  </p>  
  <p>
    Fail to live by these divine actions and you won't receive them in return.
  </p>  
  <p>Thy kingdom come.</p>
  <p>Thy will be done.</p>
  <p>On Earth, as it is in Heaven.</p>
