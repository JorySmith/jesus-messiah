      Ask, and it will be given to you. <br />
      Seek, and you will find. <br />
      Knock, and the door will be opened to you.

    <p>
      A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, <br />
      nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. <br />
      Every tree that does not bear good fruit, <br />
      is cut down and thrown into the fire.<br />
      Therefore, by their fruits, you will know them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be Righteous, Grateful, and Generous to all People.<br />
      Be Wise, Trustworthy, and Forgiving of all People.<br />
      Be Courageous, Compassionate, and Loving to all People.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy kingdom come. <br />
      Thy will be done, <br />
      on Earth, as it is in Heaven.
