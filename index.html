      Ask, and it will be given to you. <br />
      Seek, and you will find. <br />
      Knock, and the door will be opened to you.<br />
      For the Son of Man did not come to be served, <br />
      but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. <br />
      Therefore, by their fruits, you will know them.<br />
      For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction. <br />
      Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life.
    </p>
    <p>       
      To overcome evil, you must see it. <br />
      To seek God, the Highest Good, you must aim for it. <br />
      To sin, is to miss your aim. <br />
      How can we ever seek righteousness if we deny sin? <br />
      How can we ever be forgiven and healed spiritually if we deny our sins? <br />
      Jesus's love and forgiveness are unlimited. <br />
      But to receive it, you must see your sins and correct them.<br />
      <br />
      At all times, you are serving either the Highest Good or the lowest evil. <br />
      To serve God, the Highest Good, follow in the footsteps of Jesus:
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Be Righteous, Grateful, and Generous to all People, like Him.<br />
      Be Wise, Trustworthy, and Forgiving to all People, like Him.<br />
      Be Courageous, Compassionate, and Loving to all People, like Him.<br />
      Avoid the nine deadly sins: wickedness, cowardice, <br />
      pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth, like Him.<br />
      <br />
      You're not alone. Ask for His help if you need it. Pray, like Him.<br />
      Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, like Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy Kingdom come. <br />
      Thy Will be done, <br />
      on Earth as it is in Heaven.
    </p>
