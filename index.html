      Ask, and it will be given to you. <br />
      Seek, and you will find. <br />
      Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Son of Man did not come to be served, <br />
      but to serve, and to give his life as a <br />
      ransom for many.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, <br />
      nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. <br />
      Every tree that does not bear good fruit, <br />
      is cut down and thrown into the fire.<br />
      Therefore, by their fruits, you will know them.

    <p>
    For wide is the gate and broad is the way <br />
      that leads to destruction. Because narrow is <br />
      the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be Righteous, Grateful, and Generous to all People.<br />
      Be Wise, Trustworthy, and Forgiving of all People.<br />
      Be Courageous, Compassionate, and Loving to all People.<br />
      Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy kingdom come. <br />
      Thy will be done, <br />
      on Earth as it is in Heaven.
