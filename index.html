  <h1>Jesus</h1>
  <h2>A Righteous Role Model of the Highest Good</h2>
  <p>His Holy Words, Divine Actions, and Righteous Will:</p>
  <p>
    Ask, and it will be given to you. </br>
    Seek, and you will find. </br>
    Knock, and the door will be opened to you. 
  </p>  
  <p>
     A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. <br/>
     Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.<br/> 
    Therefore by their fruits, you will know them.
  </p>
  <p>   
    Be Righteous, Grateful, and Generous to all People.</br>
    Be Wise, Trustworthy, and Forgiving of all People.</br>
    Be Courageous, Compassionate, and Loving to all People.
  </p>    
  <p>Thy kingdom come.</p>
  <p>Thy will be done,</p>
  <p>on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</p>
